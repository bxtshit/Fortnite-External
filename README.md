Outdated Fortnite External

Project for Valiant, I give proper credits to, "blinq"/ "Interpreter"/"__writecr4(miraka.)"
They have taught me everything I know, I prop blinq the most for the months that we were good friends for, hope the best for each and everyone one of them.

This source is partially unfinished, but it is a very good base to begin with, it has a optimized cache, clean code (classes), easy to work with, etc. 

Thank you everyone for the time we spent together, I have officially quit my time with the Fortnite Cheating community, though in the future I may work on projects for myself.
